<h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items described in Assignment and Report Specifications</b></h1>
<p><br></p>
<p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>upload this assignment.html file in your website directory during part 2.3 of Lab 1</li>
  <li>later, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
  <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
  <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
    delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
    mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
    differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
    better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
    look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
    might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
    it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
    it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
    style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
assignment tasks.</li>
  <li>provide details for your best student forums posts where indicated</li>
  <li>provide the date you attended the continuous improvement session where indicated</li>
  <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
  <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>2.0 Part 2 Tasks</b></h1>
<h2><b>2.1 Image Map</b></h2>
<p><a href = "image map/map.html"> I use the travel map as the image map for the site</a> <strong>mark this one.</strong> Specificly, the location of Sydney, Canberra, Shanghai, Vancouver, France and US are clickable.</p>
<p><a href = "image map more/map.html">Advanced Version used in the Pt3</a> <strong>don't mark this one for pt2</strong> This one contains dynamic labels showing the exact location of the clickable area on the map, which is more visually appeal to the visitors.</p>
<h2><b>2.2 Photo Gallery</b></h2>
<p><a href = "image gallery/gallery.html"> I build the image gallery with images from my life</a></p>
<h2><b>2.3b Javascript and 2.4b Well written Javascript</b></h2>
  <h3>2.3b</h3>
  <p><a href = "image gallery/gallery.html">The javascript code is used for gallery image</a></p>
  <h3>2.4b</h3>
  <p><a href = "image gallery/gallery.js">The javascript code file itself</a></p>
<p>
My best javascript components is: <br> 
#1 pop-up window for the image gallery page: <br> 
Feature1: the main body of this js file implements a function for the onclick event that 
the pop-up window will show the original full-size image in a larger window when the user click on the image. 
The displayed image in the gallery in the thumbnail image with smaller file size, which allows for faster loading speed. The general workflow of this feature is:
getComputedStyle and getPropertyValue will get you the thumbnail directory. 
Next use split and replace to get the original image directory.
Create the pop-up window by createElement and appendChild will append it into the container. 
Lastly, setAttribute to this element.<br> 

Feature2: With the new window of original image being displayed when click the thumbnail images, the onload event is defined to get the width of the pop-up window 
so that the next/prev button can be placed next to the new pop-up window regardless of large or small width of original image.
<br> 
Functions like closeImg() is defined so that when you click outside of the pop-up window, this window will be closed. The function changeImg is defined so that the next/prev button will direct 
to next image or previous image. It makes sure that the next image of the last one will direct to the first image and vice versa.

<p>It is linked to <a href = "pages/me.html">About Me</a>, although I linked it to the About Page, it is not related to my website's overall purpose.</p>
<h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
<p> Note that there are two css I design</p>

<ul>
  <li>  For the index.html: </li>
  <ul>  <li> I design a alterview view specificly for index.html, you can click the <b>VIEW</b> button in the header of index.html to activate it. 
    It hides More about Me section and displays the new Timeline section instead. It also changed the background image, change fonts, add more text to the first page.</li>
  <li>The code is at <a href="alternative.css">index alternative code</a></li></ul>
  <li>  For the rest page: </li>
  <ul>  <li> I design a generic print friendly version css for all other pages part from index.html. You can click the <b>VIEW</b> button in the header of all other pages to activate it. </li>

<p>Note that there is error appear in only index.html, all other pages are fine.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Line 286, 305, 325, 346. This error appears four times with the same usage. I deliberately design it for the filp card function in the connection section. 
    Error of div element is child of label tag, 
    The purpose of design this entire structure within a 
    label tag is to make the entire card clickable. 
    Clicking anywhere within the label, including the card content, will toggle the associated checkbox's state. 
    It triggers actions of flipping when interacting with the card. The div element within the label tag is used to contained the information of this person.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
  <ul> <b>Mark</b> the Todo functionality
  <li>This is the to-do list for myself. It uses advanced javascript that allows you to add and remove things. Play around with it to complete or delete the todo ltems. There is a filter on the right hand side to display the completed items. It supports sycn with the local cache. 
    Refer to <a href = "pages/ToDoList.css"> todo css file</a>, <a href = "pages/ToDoList.html"> todo html file</a> and <a href="pages/ToDoList.js">todo js file </a></li>
